TSCBL - TURGEN SYSTEM CASSETTE BINARY LOADER
Version 1.1
================================================================================

Overview
--------
TSCBL is a simple binary loader for cassettes. TSCBL loads DOS 2 binary
load files from cassette stored in the standard format used by the C: CIO
device. The INITAD jumps are fully supported, the motor is stopped when these
jumps are performed.

Errors
------
A light gray screen indicates that the loaded file is not a binary load file.
Press any key to restart the loader

A purple screen indicates loading error.
Press any key to restart the loader.

Controls
--------
Press RESET to perform warm start and restart the loader.
Holding SELECT during restart of the loader will initiate cold start
of the computer.

Customization
-------------
TSCBL can be customized by changing bytes close to the end of the loader
code. 
Navigate to the eye-catcher '@CBL' and note its offset as 0.
You can then change bytes as follows:

Offset (decimal)   Length   Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
 0                      4   '@CBL' eye-catcher
 4                      1   Clear screen character #125      
 5                     34   File name (ATASCII)
39                      1   End of line #155
40                      1   Background color
41                      1   Foreground color (luminance)
42                      1   SOUNDR (Set to 0 for silent I/O)
43                      1   CRSINH (Set to 1 to hide cursor)  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Segments
--------
TSCBL expects binary load files to begin with the 255 255 header. Additional
255 255 headers before other segments are tolerated. TSCBL doesn't set RUNAD
to the first segment loaded. Binary load files without RUNAD are not started.

IOCB
----
TSCBL uses IOCB #1 to read the binary load file.

Inter-Record-Gaps
-----------------
TSCBL expects short inter-record-gaps (250 ms) between blocks,
except gaps after blocks that hold INIT vectors. As the motor is switched off
after blocks that hold INIT vectors, gaps of at least 1200 ms are needed.
This must be guaranteed by a utility that converts the binary load file
to standard tape records.
